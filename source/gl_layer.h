/* gl_layer.h -- the EGL/GLES provider the engine is linked against.
 *
 * libunity imports the egl* entry points directly (DT_NEEDED libEGL) and finds
 * every gl* function at run time through eglGetProcAddress / dlsym. Both go
 * through this interface, so the backend is swappable in one place:
 *
 *   gl_null.c   a null driver: correct object/query semantics, no rendering.
 *               Lets the engine, Mono and the game scripts boot and run their
 *               frame loop on an emulator before the 32-bit mesa build exists.
 *   gl_mesa.c   (later) Mesa/nouveau (mesa32) cross-built for AArch32.
 * MIT.
